I am a Machine Learning Engineer and I have always been highly motivated in Machine Learning and AI. I have experience in building Machine Learning models for real-world applications as solutions. 


My main motivation is **Research and Development** of solutions to be implemented in different dimensions for *Social Good*.

I'm trying my hands on Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
My projects are [listed below.]()

I have exquisite management skills developed by managing teams, volunteers, artists and big events like Art Festivals for years in a row.
I'm a passionate writer and a storyteller. 

I have a small blog of my works I write in the name of [The Road via Heart, Soul and the Brain](https://thearavindnaidublog.wordpress.com)
