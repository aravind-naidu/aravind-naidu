And I appreciate the part where my stars were aligned in such a way, that finding my purpose was not a challenging task.
From a pretty young age, I knew that I wanted to make a positive difference in this world and the people living in it.
Science was a pretty interesting subject that kept intriguing my curious budding mind and I saw myself reading books and stumbling upon studies by various researchers and most importantly how Albert Einstine, Stephen Hawking, and A. P. J Abdul Kalam inspired me to follow their footsteps into the fascinating discipline of technology.

Currently, I'm an engineer with my major as Electronics and Telecommunications, but Artificial Intelligence always captivated my interest, so I pitched in my idle time to learn Machine Learning on my own by various online courses, research papers and following experts into this field. 
I applied my knowledge to building Machine Learning models for real-world applications as solutions. 
My current work comprises of Research and Development of Machine Learning solutions, as well as training freshers in AI and Machine Learning.

Having the knowledge of Science and technology is no less than a superpower, the impulse that pushes me forward is the variation I want to create in society, for the good.
Wanting to work in research and development, I want to advance my drive from scratch. 

I believe learning is a continuous process and should not be stopped and so I'm presently growing myself in the fields of Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 

Always welcoming discussions that feeds my mind and calms my curiosity.
