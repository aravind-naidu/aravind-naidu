I have always been highly motivated in Machine Learning and AI. I have experience in building Machine Learning models for real-world applications as solutions

My main motivation is Research and Development of solutions to implement in different dimensions for Social Good.

Iâ€™m trying my hands on Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

I have years of experience of team leading in NGOs working on social issues since my high school.
Have exquisite management skills developed by managing artists and big events like Art Festivals for years in a row.

Apart from that, I love to write stories and poems.
I perform frequently at Open Mics.
